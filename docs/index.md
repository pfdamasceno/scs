#  Scientific Computing Services (SCS)

SCS provides hardware computing support for research, which include linux workstations, high performance computing clusters and connectivity for lab equipment as well as software support on those systems for the Radiology department.

The SCS HPC environment is available to researchers in the Radiology department under a fair-share model where contributors get higher access priority than non-contributing members.  

**Please note**: The current SCS HPC environment is *not* certified for use with Protected Health Information (PHI).  Data containing PHI must not be transferred to, mounted on, or processed with any Wynton cluster resources.  If you have questions regarding the security status of your data, please contact the [UCSF Privacy Office].
